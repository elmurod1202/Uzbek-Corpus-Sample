# Uzbek Corpus Sample

## Description

**Uzbek Corpus Sample** is a repository that contains a small-sized raw text corpus of the Uzbek language. This corpus is specifically curated for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, providing a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts interested in Uzbek language analysis.

The corpus comprises **100,000 sentences**, with each sentence conveniently stored in a separate line within the included `uzbek_corpus.txt` file. These sentences were meticulously collected from various openly available text sources, including online articles, books, and other literary works in Uzbek.
